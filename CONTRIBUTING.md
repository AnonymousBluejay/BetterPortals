# Contributing to BetterPortals

Contributions are welcome, big or small!
- For small contributions and minor bug fixes, feel free to just PR out of the blue.
- For large contributions, it'd be great if you could open and issue and describe what you're doing, so I can give you some pointers.

## Pull Requesting
- Please try to test your changes as much as possible to avoid them causing issues in other parts of the plugin.
- Try to keep to the existing code format. If you really don't like how I've done something, feel free to change it but explain what you don't like so that I can learn :)


## Current TODO List
These are things that would be especially useful as contributions.

- Any bug fixes.
- Redis support instead of the current system for cross-server portals, since I'm aware that it's kind of janky.
