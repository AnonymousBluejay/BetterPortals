# Stores the offset from the corners of the portal where the collision box will be
# This collision box is how the portal effect is calculated

# The default values are tuned to work fairly well, so I don't recommend changing these

# Stores the links between worlds. By default this links the overworld and the nether with portals
# There are two links for the overworld and the nether - one for each way.
# This is to allow one way links between dimensions
# The x and z coordinates of the portals are multiplied by the coordinateRescalingFactor to spawn portals
# The min and max spawn y limit where portals can spawn - for instance you should not be able to spawn portals above the nether ceiling
