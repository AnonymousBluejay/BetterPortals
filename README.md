# BetterPortals
BetterPortals is a minecraft spigot plugin which allows you to see through nether portals to look at the blocks on the other side.

It is intended to provide an experience similar to the BetterPortals mod, but as a spigot plugin, so that the users don't need to install anything. It also has the advantage of far greater performance, although it can still lag the server if you set the render distance too high.

This plugin is quite configurable, if you wish to change the size and nature of the portal effect you can

## Benefits
* Since this is a plugin, players don't need to install a mod on the client side
* While it does still cause *some* lag, it is overall much faster than the BetterPortals mod

## Upcoming Features
* Lag compensation to make it work better for players with higher ping

## Limitations
* BetterPortals essentially just changes the blocks in the player's view through the portal. Because of this is is more of an illusion.
* It is currently unusable for players with high ping, as they just see the blocks on the other side of the portal if they move too quickly
* There is still a loading screen when moving between worlds. This could be removed with the WorldChangeScreenRemover plugin
