# BetterPortals
BetterPortals is a minecraft spigot plugin which allows you to see through nether portals to look at the blocks on the other side.

It aims to provide a similar experience to the BetterPortals mod, but as a plugin, so it requires no client side mods.

This works pretty well for players with low ping (under 50 ms), and portal animations are pretty smooth.

For more info, see the plugin's [Spigot Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betterportals.75409/)

## Features
- Viewing blocks through nether portals.
- Viewing entities through portals.
- Creating your own custom portals (in a way like MultiversePortals).
- Horizontal custom portals.
- Creating portals between multiple servers. (AKA cross-server portals)

## Limitations
Of course, being a plugin, there are several limitations.
- Sign text cannot currently be seen through portals.
- Portal animations can lag players if not using optifine.
- Players with high ping see artifacts of the portal projection.
- Much longer render distances lag both players and the server.

## Future Plans
- Improve performance to allow for much longer render distances.
