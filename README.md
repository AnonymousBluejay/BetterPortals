# BetterPortals
BetterPortals is a minecraft spigot plugin which allows you too see through nether portals to look at the blocks on the other side.

It is intended to provide an experience similar to the BetterPortals mod, but as a spigot plugin, so that the users don't need to install anything. It also has the advantage of far greater performance, although it can still lag the server if you set the render distance too high.

This plugin is quite configurable, if you wish to change the size and nature of the portal effect you can

## Upcoming Features
* Lag compensation to make it work better for players with higher ping
* Performance optimizations (hopefully!), to allow for larger render distances

## Benefits
* Since this is a plugin, players don't need to install a mod on the client side
* While it does still cause *some* lag, it is overall much faster than the BetterPortals mod

## Limitations
* BetterPortals essentially just changes the blocks in the player's view through the portal. Because of this is is more of an illusion.
* It is currently unusable for players with high ping, as they just see the blocks on the other side of the portal if they move too quickly
* Mobs cannot currently be seen through portals
* Portals have a very low render distance
* There is still a loading screen when moving between worlds
