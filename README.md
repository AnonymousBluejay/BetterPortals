# BetterPortals Rewrite
BetterPortals is a minecraft spigot plugin which allows you to see through nether portals to look at the blocks on the other side.

This rewrite aims to increase stability, reduce the use of NMS code & reflection and generally improve the code.
It makes use of Google Guice for dependency injection. The build system has also been switched to gradle.
